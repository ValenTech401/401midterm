### Client Pitch

We are thrilled to have the opportunity to collaborate with you on this vital project. Our team has been specifically contracted to elevate the cybersecurity landscape of your AWS Cloud infrastructure. Our focus is on fortifying your systems against adversarial activities through comprehensive logging, meticulous monitoring, and proactive detection strategies. Our approach is threefold:

1. **IAM Best Practices:** Ensuring the principle of least privilege is adhered to.

2. **Infrastructure Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Deployment of Sysmon for monitoring.
   - Hardening includes taking CIS-compliant Windows Server DC within a private subnet of your VPC, accessible only through VPN tunneling.
   - Linux server instance will be meticulously configured to house your sensitive PII and PCI data, with encryption both at rest and in transit.

3. **SIEM/Log Aggregation:**
   - Utilizing top-tier CloudWatch, we will configure a real-time event log ingestion system from key assets, including EC2 instances.
   - This will enable us to swiftly identify and mitigate threats, ensuring continuous protection.

To top it off, we will implement **Cloud Monitoring with AWS Lambda.** Our strategy extends to leveraging VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic meticulously. AWS Lambda functions will be employed to automate responses to detect threats.

We are eager to embark on this journey with you, safeguarding your digital assets and fostering a secure cloud environment. Thank you for considering our team for this crucial initiative.

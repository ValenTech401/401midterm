- All personnel must report any anomalies or suspicious activities to the IT Security Team promptly.

## Prerequisites:
- Understanding of PCI DSS requirements.
- Access to necessary monitoring tools and systems.
- Training on identifying and reporting suspicious network activities.

## Procedure:

1. **Selection of Monitoring Tools:**
   - Choose PCI DSS-compliant network monitoring tools.
   - Ensure the selected tools are capable of monitoring all relevant network segments.

2. **Configuration of Monitoring Tools:**
   - Configure monitoring tools to capture and analyze network traffic.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities and anomalies.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring to track network activities in real-time.
   - Regularly update and refine monitoring configurations based on emerging threats.

4. **Log Retention and Analysis:**
   - Establish a log retention policy in accordance with PCI DSS requirements.
   - Regularly analyze logs to identify and respond to security incidents.

5. **Incident Response:**
   - Develop an incident response plan for handling security incidents.
   - Ensure all personnel are familiar with the incident response procedures.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed documentation of network monitoring configurations and activities.
   - Document any changes made to monitoring tools or configurations.

# Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan

## I. Introduction

This Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a cybersecurity incident. The plan is designed to address and mitigate the impact of security incidents in alignment with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53.

## II. Objectives

The objectives of this plan are to:
- Identify and categorize cybersecurity incidents promptly.
- Contain and mitigate the impact of incidents.
- Investigate and analyze the root cause of incidents.
- Communicate effectively with relevant stakeholders.
- Recover systems and services to normal operations.
- Implement lessons learned for continuous improvement.

## III. Roles and Responsibilities

### Incident Response Team (IRT):
- **IRT Lead:** Designated team member responsible for coordinating incident response efforts.
- **IRT Members:** Security analysts, system administrators, and other relevant personnel.

### Communication Team:
- **Communication Lead:** Handles internal and external communication during and after incidents.
- **Communication Members:** Public relations, legal, and designated spokespersons.

### Technical Team:
- **Technical Lead:** Oversees technical aspects of incident response.
- **Technical Members:** Cybersecurity experts, system administrators, and network engineers.

## IV. Incident Detection and Reporting

**Security Controls (NIST 800-53):**
- AC-2: Account Management: Review and disable compromised accounts.
- AU-6: Audit Trail: Analyze audit logs for signs of unauthorized access.
- IR-4: Incident Handling: Follow incident handling procedures.
- SI-4: Information System Monitoring: Utilize monitoring tools for real-time detection.

**Detection and Reporting Process:**
- Utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to monitor abnormal activities.
- Establish incident triggers based on predefined thresholds.
- Immediately report any suspicious activity to the Incident Response Team.

## V. Incident Response Process

**Security Controls (NIST 800-53):**
- IR-3: Incident Response Training and Exercises: Regularly conduct incident response training and tabletop exercises.
- IR-5: Incident Monitoring: Continuously monitor for incidents.
- IR-8: Incident Response Plan: Follow the incident response plan.

**Incident Handling Steps:**
1. **Identification:**
   - Confirm and validate the incident using SIEM tools and manual analysis.
   - Assign severity levels based on impact and risk.
2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems by disabling network access or implementing firewall rules.
   - Limit further damage or unauthorized access.
3. **Eradication:**
   - Remove malware or unauthorized access.
   - Patch vulnerabilities contributing to the incident.
4. **Recovery:**
   - Restore systems and services to normal operations.
   - Validate the effectiveness of the recovery.
5. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review, documenting findings and actions taken.
   - Update incident response procedures based on lessons learned.

## VI. Communication Plan

**Internal Communication:**
- Notify the incident internally to relevant teams through established communication channels.
- Provide regular updates on the incident response progress to management and stakeholders.

**External Communication:**
- Coordinate with external stakeholders as needed, in compliance with legal and regulatory reporting requirements.
- Designate a spokesperson for external communication.

## VII. Training and Awareness

**Security Controls (NIST 800-53):**
- IR-3: Incident Response Training and Exercises: Regularly train the Incident Response Team on incident response procedures.

**Training Initiatives:**
- Conduct regular incident response training for the Incident Response Team, ensuring they are familiar with the NIST 800-53 controls.
- Raise awareness among all employees regarding potential security threats through training sessions and awareness programs.

## VIII. Review and Audit

**Security Controls (NIST 800-53):**
- AU-12: Audit Generation: Regularly generate and review audit logs for incident detection.
- CM-8: Information System Component Inventory: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of system components.

**Review Process:**
- Periodically review and update the incident response plan based on changes in the organization's infrastructure or cybersecurity landscape.
- Conduct audits to ensure compliance with the NIST 800-53 controls and the incident response plan.

## IX. Test Plan and Monitoring Solutions

**Test Plan:**
- Develop a comprehensive test plan for security controls, including procedures for testing incident detection and response capabilities.
- Regularly conduct simulated cyber attack scenarios to test the effectiveness of security controls.

**Monitoring Solutions Diagram:**
- Create a diagram illustrating the expected events when an attack triggers monitoring tools.
- Include details on how monitoring solutions respond to different types of incidents.

## X. Compliance Documentation

**Compliance Framework (PCI DSS):**

Splunk

A fun piece of Malware was created for demonstration purposes for what Splunk detects on your system

Here is the friendly malware: It is a python script called [h.py](https://github.com/ValenTech401/401midterm/blob/main/h.py) that pops up the heart picture upon 
Starting the Windows Operating System that managed to get on the computer by a phishing attack.
Once the person got a hold of the Administrator's password, thankfully they didn’t do anything more than 
Send a nice Valentine Gift!

When you go through Splunk files you can find when the person downloaded this script and the .png as you see below

This can be avoided when there is [Multi Factor Authentication]() in place as well as stronger passwords implemented with pass keys, and [systems hardening](https://github.com/ValenTech401/401midterm/blob/main/serverhardening.md)

The [VPN]() tunnel is a secure means to transfer data from one site to another, but if the login requirements are weak, the vpn tunnel can become a weapon and a point of vulnerability.

Apart from [Splunk](), [AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail]() as well as using [lambda function](https://github.com/ValenTech401/401midterm/tree/main/lambda) and [agents]() are good means of monitoring activity on your network and Operating Systems.

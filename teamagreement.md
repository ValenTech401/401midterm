## Create a Conflict and Confrontation Plan

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict when it arises? | Establish a structured conflict resolution process that involves open communication, active listening, and collaboration. Encourage parties to express concerns and work together to find mutually acceptable solutions. |
| How will your group determine whether a conflict calls for intervention or resolution? Is that a collective decision, or one that can be made unilaterally by a single member? | Establish criteria for distinguishing between conflicts that can be resolved within the team and those requiring external intervention. Make it a collective decision, ensuring input from all involved parties. |
| What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? | Address the issue through team discussions, emphasizing the importance of equal participation. If necessary, involve a neutral mediator to facilitate the discussion. |
| How will you address concerns with a member who is worried that the group is not reaching a high enough standard? | Acknowledge the concern and conduct a constructive discussion on ways to elevate the group's performance. Establish clear performance expectations and encourage collaborative efforts to meet high standards. |
| How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? | Emphasize the value of diversity in skills and perspectives within the team. Foster a culture of learning and mentorship, encouraging members to share knowledge and support each other's growth. |
| How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? | Address the issue privately, focusing on specific behaviors rather than personal attacks. Clearly communicate expectations, provide constructive feedback, and offer support to help the individual contribute effectively. If needed, involve a team leader or facilitator. |
| How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? | Define clear escalation procedures, such as involving a team leader, mediator, or higher authority, when internal resolution attempts fail. Establish a timeline for escalation based on the severity and persistence of the conflict. |
| How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up and communicating honestly? | Foster a culture of psychological safety by promoting open communication, active listening, and non-judgmental responses. Encourage feedback, respect diverse opinions, and address any behaviors that undermine a safe and inclusive environment. |

## Establish a Communication Plan

| Question | Response |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Approach to Day-to-Day Work** | We will implement cross-training sessions to ensure each team member gains knowledge in different project aspects. Regular team meetings will be held to discuss progress and address any questions or concerns. |
| **Availability for Communication** | Team members will be available for communication during standard working hours, from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday. Individual schedules may vary, but core collaboration hours will be established for real-time communication. |
| **Communication Platform** | Communication will occur on Slack for real-time messaging and collaboration. We will use Slack for formal communication and project updates as well. |
| **Work Breaks** | A standard work-break schedule of 60 minutes of focused work, followed by a 10-20 minute break, will be encouraged. This ensures productivity and prevents burnout. |
| **Seeking Assistance** | Team members will use designated communication channels (e.g., Slack) to ask for assistance. We will also maintain an open-door policy, encouraging direct messages or quick meetings for immediate problem-solving. |
| **Asking for Assistance** | Problems will be outlined, steps taken so far. Expected to have consulted relevant project documentation and undertaken basic problem-solving before seeking help. |
| **Identifying Falling Behind** | Regular progress check-ins and milestone tracking will help identify if we are falling behind. Check up every 2 hours on REMO where each Team Member is at and working on. |
| **Handling Falling Behind** | Proactive approach: identify the root cause of delays. Tasks may be reprioritized. Adjust timelines and collaborate to find a solution to the problem. |
| **After-Hours Communication** | While after-hours communication may occur for urgent matters, it will be kept to a minimum to respect work-life balance. Weekend communication is reserved for critical situations, and team members will be notified in advance if such instances arise. |
| **Ensuring Everyone’s Voice is Heard** | Regular team meetings will include designated time for open discussion, and everyone will have an opportunity to share their perspectives. Anonymous feedback mechanisms may be implemented to encourage input from all team members. |
| **Managing Different Time Zones** | We will implement a flexible scheduling strategy to accommodate team members in different time zones. Core collaboration hours will be established where all team members are expected to overlap for real-time communication. Additionally, asynchronous communication tools, such as shared project documentation and messages on platforms like Slack, will be utilized to bridge time zone gaps. Regular team meetings may be rotated to accommodate different time zones. Clear communication about availability and expectations will be crucial to ensuring effective collaboration across diverse time zones. |
| **Existing Commitments** | At the beginning of the project, each team member will provide a schedule of existing commitments such as doctor's appointments, childcare responsibilities, and certification tests. This information will be used to establish a shared team calendar, allowing everyone to be aware of each other's availability and plan work around these commitments. We will encourage open communication regarding any changes in schedules and support a work environment that respects and accommodates personal commitments. Team members are expected to proactively communicate any potential conflicts and collaborate with the team to find suitable solutions. |

### Scheduling Conflicts During Core Work Hours

| Scotty Jokon | I just work on the weekends 3pm-11pm |
| Christen Reinhart | I have a VA appointment, but it is outside of 1000-2200. Unless I get held up longer than expected which tends to happen at the VA it shouldn't be an issue. |
| Nathalie Abdallah | So far no dates conflict, will keep you updated |
| Eveangalina Campos | Regular school pickup for my daughter at 3PM (MST) durring the week. Thurs is early release at 1PM. I usually step away to cook after pick up's and then I'm right back. |

### Working Outside of Core Hours

| Team Member | Expectation of Working Outside Core Hours |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Andrew Carroll | No one “expects” to be working outside of time bounds. |
| Scotty Jokon | Depending on how the project progresses, it has been necessary before. |
| Christen Reinhart | Depending on how the project progresses, it has been necessary before. |
| Nathalie Abdallah | I like my time being respected, and I also respect other people’s time. But emergencies arise. Emergency is defined as something that could not have been prevented by proper planning. |
